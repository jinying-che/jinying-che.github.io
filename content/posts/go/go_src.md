Dive into golang standard library, where we can learn how high quality code is written and what the Golang convention and style is.

### sync.WaitGroup
```golang
type WaitGroup struct {
	noCopy noCopy

	// 64-bit value: high 32 bits are counter, low 32 bits are waiter count.
	// 64-bit atomic operations require 64-bit alignment, but 32-bit
	// compilers only guarantee that 64-bit fields are 32-bit aligned.
	// For this reason on 32 bit architectures we need to check in state()
	// if state1 is aligned or not, and dynamically "swap" the field order if
	// needed.
	state1 uint64
	state2 uint32
}
```
- It's based on golang **semaphore** model, implemented by `runtime_Semrelease` and `runtime_Semacquire`
  > semaphore is common mechanism used in concurrent progamming, like [Readersâ€“writers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writers_problem)
- **state1** includes counter, waiter and semahpore, which obtained by `func (wg *WaitGroup) state() (statep *uint64, semap *uint32)`
