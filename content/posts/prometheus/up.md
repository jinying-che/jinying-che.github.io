# Understanding the Prometheus `up` Metric

## Overview

The `up` metric is one of the most fundamental metrics in Prometheus. It indicates whether a target (service, endpoint, or exporter) is currently accessible and responding to Prometheus scrapes.

## What is the `up` Metric?

The `up` metric is automatically generated by Prometheus for every target it scrapes. It's not provided by the target itself, but rather calculated by Prometheus based on the success or failure of scrape attempts.

## Possible Status Values

The `up` metric has **3 possible states**:

| Status | Value | Meaning | When it occurs |
|:-------|:------|:--------|:---------------|
| **UP** | `up = 1` | Target is accessible and responding successfully | • Scrape returns HTTP 200<br>• Target responds within timeout<br>• Valid Prometheus metrics format<br>• No network issues |
| **DOWN** | `up = 0` | Target is not accessible or not responding properly | • Network connectivity issues<br>• HTTP error status codes (4xx, 5xx)<br>• Target exceeds scrape timeout<br>• Malformed metrics response<br>• Target completely unreachable |
| **MISSING** | No `up` metric | Target has never been scraped or is not configured | • Target not in Prometheus configuration<br>• Service discovery hasn't found the target<br>• Target was never successfully scraped<br>• Configuration error preventing scraping |

### Detailed Explanation

#### 1. `up = 1` (Target is UP)
- **Meaning**: The target is accessible and responding successfully
- **When it occurs**:
  - The scrape request returns HTTP 200 status code
  - The target responds within the configured timeout
  - The response contains valid Prometheus metrics format
  - No network connectivity issues

#### 2. `up = 0` (Target is DOWN)
- **Meaning**: The target is not accessible or not responding properly
- **When it occurs**:
  - Network connectivity issues (DNS resolution failure, connection timeout)
  - Target returns HTTP error status codes (4xx, 5xx)
  - Target doesn't respond within the configured scrape timeout
  - Target returns malformed metrics (invalid Prometheus format)
  - Target is completely unreachable

#### 3. Missing `up` metric
- **Meaning**: The target has never been scraped or is not configured
- **When it occurs**:
  - Target is not included in Prometheus configuration
  - Service discovery hasn't discovered the target yet
  - Target was never successfully scraped (even once)
  - Configuration error preventing Prometheus from attempting to scrape
  - Target was removed from configuration but still appears in queries

## Key Characteristics

### Automatic Generation
- Prometheus automatically creates this metric for every configured target
- No need to explicitly expose this metric from your application
- Available for all scrape targets (applications, exporters, etc.)

### Labels
The `up` metric includes labels that identify the target:
```
up{instance="localhost:9090", job="prometheus"} 1
up{instance="localhost:9100", job="node-exporter"} 0
```

Common labels:
- `instance`: The target's address (host:port)
- `job`: The job name from Prometheus configuration
- Additional labels from `relabel_configs`

## Troubleshooting

### When `up = 0`

1. **Check Network Connectivity**
   ```bash
   curl -v http://target:port/metrics
   ```

2. **Verify Target Configuration**
   - Correct host and port
   - Valid scrape path (usually `/metrics`)
   - Proper authentication if required

3. **Check Target Logs**
   - Application errors
   - Resource constraints (CPU, memory)
   - Port binding issues

4. **Prometheus Configuration**
   - Scrape interval settings
   - Timeout configurations
   - Label configurations

### Common Issues

- **DNS Resolution**: Target hostname cannot be resolved
- **Port Issues**: Target not listening on expected port
- **Authentication**: Missing or incorrect credentials
- **Firewall**: Network blocking access to target
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Target too busy to respond

## Summary

The `up` metric indicates the status of Prometheus targets with **3 possible states**: `1` (up), `0` (down), or missing (not configured/never scraped). It's automatically generated by Prometheus and is essential for monitoring the health of your infrastructure. Understanding all three states is crucial for effective monitoring and alerting in Prometheus-based observability stacks.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **3 possible states**: `1` (up), `0` (down), or missing
- Automatically generated by Prometheus for configured targets
- Missing state indicates configuration or discovery issues
- Essential for comprehensive target health monitoring
- Foundation for reliable alerting systems
- Works with all service discovery mechanisms
- Use `absent()` function to detect missing targets
