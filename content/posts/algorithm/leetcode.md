When do you play with [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)? Personally, I open it only before the algorithm interview.

It's wrong actually, the algorithm is not only used in the interview but also really useful in the production, which also make you write the effective code in the daily work. Leetcode helps interview a lot indeed, I sometimes can see some guys who get the Google offer by leetcode, moreover, I believe more algorithm we learned better engineer we can be.

This post is showing that how I leetcode, it's only my personal approach, I usually try to understand the one algorithm completely, then try to search by tag and resolve the problems from easy to hard.

Enjoy the Algorithm, let's leetcode!
